# Linked Open Election Framework

# Situation Analysis
In most part of the world, there is hardly any freely available database of political election results in existence. This is because the data required to compile it is located in different websites or documents. The information is presented in many different formats and many different ways, and the only way the information can be compiled for re-use is by manual methods.

The Linked Open Election Framework is supporting the publication of election results as <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Thing" itemid="http://dbpedia.org/resource/HTML"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">HTML</span></a></span> (the language used to write web pages) embed <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Thing" itemid="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machine-readable_data"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_data" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">machine-readable data</span></a></span> (called "Metadata") in the source code. Though invisible to normal users, publishing the information in this way gives it structure and meaning, and allowing machines to understand its meaning.
